I have created user credential system with .JSON file. It also works

If username already exists, prints out that it already exists <br>
If username or password is incorrect, prints out that it is incorrect <br>
if username and password is correct, prints out that it is correct and logged in <br>

### FLASK:
If you type in 1234 and the password: maths>english (Will change the code to something better, but this is going to be for adding/removing users and setting permissions):
